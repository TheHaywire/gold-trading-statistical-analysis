Title: [OC] Analyzed 46K+ gold price bars from real $21K account - found 64% win rate strategy

I spent 25 days analyzing every minute of gold price movement from my real MT5 account ($21,565.76) and discovered time-based edges that consistently beat random chance.

Key discoveries:
- 3:17 AM shows 64% upward movement probability (25 trades)
- Friday is statistically the best day (60% win rate)
- Wednesday consistently underperforms (fade opportunity)

All code, data, and tools are open source on GitHub. This isn't backtested on historical data - it's forward-tested on live market conditions.
